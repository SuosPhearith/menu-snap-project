::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::>> Story <<:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
I want to create a food search system for restaurants where customers can simply scan a QR code to view the menu.

For example, let's consider a restaurant that offers a variety of dishes. Traditionally, customers would need a physical menu or
 rely on staff to take their orders. However, I aim to simplify this process for both restaurants and customers.

My idea involves providing a service where restaurants can create an account and easily manage their menu. They can list their
foods along with images, prices, discounts, and other details. This platform allows them to update or delete items as needed.
Additionally, they can set the privacy settings for their restaurant, choosing whether to display their menu to the public or
only to customers within their establishment.

Moreover, customers can conveniently place their orders using their smartphones while inside the restaurant premises. It creates a
more seamless and efficient ordering experience, eliminating the need for manual order-taking.

Optionally, I plan to incorporate a table booking feature into the system. This would allow customers to reserve tables in advance,
enhancing the overall dining experience.

The benefits of this system are manifold. For restaurants, it serves as a promotional tool, as their establishments become easily
discoverable to potential customers. For patrons, it simplifies the ordering process and provides real-time information on table
availability.

Overall, my goal is to streamline operations for both restaurants and customers, making dining experiences more enjoyable and efficient.
